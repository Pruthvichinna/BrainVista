# BrainVista
BrainVista is a deep learning-based stroke detection system using CT scan images to classify ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. It uses CNNs like AlexNet, InceptionV3, VGG19, ShuffleNet, and NASNet for feature extraction, with Genetic Algorithm(GA) for feature selection. Final classification is performed using GA-LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory) and GA-BiLSTM(BiDirectional Long Short-Term Memory) models for accurate prediction.


The Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) codes are implemented to compare the results with the GA-LSTM and GA-BiLSTM models.


Finally, the GA-BiLSTM model achieved the highest accuracy of 96.43%, outperforming all other models.
