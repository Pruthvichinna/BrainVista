# BrainVista
BrainVista is a deep learning-based stroke detection system using CT scan images to classify ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. It uses CNNs like AlexNet, InceptionV3, VGG19, ShuffleNet, and NASNet for feature extraction, with GA for feature selection. Final classification is performed using GA-LSTM and GA-BiLSTM models for accurate prediction.
