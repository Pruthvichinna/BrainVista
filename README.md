# BrainVista
BrainVista is a deep learning-based stroke detection system using CT scan images to classify ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. It uses CNNs like AlexNet, InceptionV3, VGG19, ShuffleNet, and NASNet for feature extraction, with GA for feature selection. Final classification is performed using GA-LSTM and GA-BiLSTM models for accurate prediction.


The MachineLearning(ML) and DeepLearning(DL) codes are written to compare the results of GA_LSTM and GA_BILSTM. 


Finally GA_BISTLM model obtained heighest accurcy of 96.43 compared to all the other models.
